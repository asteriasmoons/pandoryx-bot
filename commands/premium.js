ðŸŒŸ **Unlock powerful premium features for your server!**

Visit our [Server Shop](https://discord.com/servers/elyxia-bots-support-1367981386862034954) to get started.

Premium gives you:
â€¢ More customization
â€¢ Early access to new features
â€¢ Priority support

**How It Works**
When you go join a membership tier, you will receive a role in which the bot checks for when running premium commands and this will allow you premium access to those commands!

*Thank you for supporting Pandoryx!*
